On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","[object Object]","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/10.png","949,948,948,947,946,945,945,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,944,945,945,945,945,944,943,943,942,942,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,941,940,937,930,921,902,876,847,819,789,765,745,733,724,719,717,717,716,716,716,716,716,716,716,716,718,718,719,719,720,720,720,720,721,721,721,722,722,722,723,727,732,740,748,753,760,765,768,770,775,778,781,782,784,786,787,788,789,790,791,793,793,794,795,797,798,800,801,803,804,805,807,809,810,810,811,812,813,814,815,819,826,831,835,838,839,838,834,827,818,806,794,778,764,753,744,738,735,734,733","850,850,848,847,844,840,836,833,830,826,824,823,822,820,819,817,814,811,805,797,787,777,766,753,741,730,719,706,697,691,687,684,683,680,678,676,675,674,673,672,671,670,669,668,667,667,666,664,660,649,629,599,568,534,502,472,449,432,421,414,411,408,406,405,402,401,400,398,396,394,393,391,388,384,380,377,375,373,372,371,370,369,370,373,379,388,394,401,406,411,415,417,419,421,424,425,426,427,428,429,429,430,430,431,433,434,434,434,435,435,435,436,437,437,437,438,438,438,439,439,439,439,439,439,438,433,426,418,408,400,393,389,384,380,376,373,370,367,364,362,360,360,359,359","1710163491289,1710163491300,1710163491317,1710163491333,1710163491350,1710163491367,1710163491383,1710163491400,1710163491417,1710163491434,1710163491450,1710163491467,1710163491484,1710163491517,1710163491534,1710163491550,1710163491567,1710163491584,1710163491600,1710163491617,1710163491633,1710163491650,1710163491667,1710163491683,1710163491700,1710163491717,1710163491733,1710163491750,1710163491767,1710163491783,1710163491800,1710163491817,1710163491833,1710163491850,1710163491867,1710163491884,1710163491900,1710163491917,1710163491933,1710163491983,1710163492017,1710163492033,1710163492050,1710163492084,1710163492117,1710163492417,1710163492433,1710163492450,1710163492467,1710163492483,1710163492500,1710163492517,1710163492533,1710163492550,1710163492566,1710163492583,1710163492600,1710163492617,1710163492633,1710163492650,1710163492667,1710163492683,1710163492700,1710163492717,1710163492734,1710163492751,1710163492920,1710163492950,1710163492967,1710163492983,1710163493099,1710163493117,1710163493133,1710163493150,1710163493167,1710163493183,1710163493200,1710163493217,1710163493250,1710163493284,1710163493300,1710163493317,1710163493969,1710163493983,1710163494000,1710163494017,1710163494033,1710163494050,1710163494067,1710163494083,1710163494100,1710163494117,1710163494133,1710163494150,1710163494167,1710163494183,1710163494200,1710163494217,1710163494233,1710163494250,1710163494267,1710163494284,1710163494300,1710163494317,1710163494333,1710163494350,1710163498614,1710163498634,1710163498650,1710163498667,1710163498684,1710163498701,1710163498718,1710163498734,1710163498750,1710163498767,1710163498817,1710163498851,1710163498867,1710163498917,1710163498934,1710163498950,1710163499388,1710163499400,1710163499417,1710163499434,1710163499450,1710163499468,1710163499484,1710163499500,1710163499517,1710163499534,1710163499550,1710163499567,1710163499584,1710163499600,1710163499617,1710163499634,1710163499650,1710163499667,1710163499684,1710163499700,1710163499717,1710163499750","100177.79999998212","shown","2","stim/10.png","stim/8.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/5.png","964,964,964,964,963,964,965,963,963,961,956,955,954,954,955,955,956,957,958,958,958,958,958,958,957,956,954,952,951,950,949,949,949,948,948,948,951,958,971,987,1008,1032,1054,1077,1096,1116,1136,1157,1177,1198,1216,1226,1235,1241,1245,1246,1247","849,841,830,815,804,799,801,805,806,806,804,800,797,793,789,783,776,766,755,742,730,721,713,704,695,686,675,666,660,656,654,653,652,652,651,650,647,640,630,616,598,572,548,525,505,485,469,454,440,427,415,401,389,379,371,366,364","1710163538536,1710163538552,1710163538569,1710163538586,1710163538602,1710163538619,1710163538636,1710163538653,1710163538789,1710163538803,1710163538820,1710163538836,1710163538853,1710163538869,1710163538886,1710163538902,1710163538919,1710163538936,1710163538952,1710163538969,1710163538986,1710163539002,1710163539019,1710163539036,1710163539052,1710163539069,1710163539086,1710163539102,1710163539119,1710163539136,1710163539153,1710163539169,1710163539186,1710163539203,1710163539220,1710163541554,1710163541569,1710163541586,1710163541603,1710163541619,1710163541636,1710163541653,1710163541669,1710163541686,1710163541703,1710163541719,1710163541736,1710163541753,1710163541769,1710163541786,1710163541803,1710163541819,1710163541836,1710163541853,1710163541869,1710163541886,1710163541903","147424.69999998808","shown","6","stim/9.png","stim/5.png","",""

On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

If you was monitoring time, you would see that the mouse was stationary for 15 seconds, which then suggests that the decision was hard to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","fixationMouse","","","","","","","","","","","","null",""

On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/12.png","976,977,981,985,986,986,984,981,977,971,964,961,966,964,964,963,961,961,958,954,949,947,945,945,945,945,944,943,940,940,937,936,935,934,933,933,933,934,935,938,943,950,955,959,962,965,966,967,969,972,974,978,983,988,993,996,998,999,1000,1001,1004,1007,1009,1013,1015,1018,1019,1022,1027,1032,1036,1040,1042,1044,1045,1046,1048,1049,1049,1050,1050,1051,1051,1052,1052,1053,1053,1054,1054,1056,1057,1058,1058,1058,1058,1058,1058,1058,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1062,1062,1061,1059,1056,1054,1051,1048,1044,1039,1031,1019,999,970,930,886,847,812,784,763,746,735,732,732","834,831,822,809,790,767,745,726,710,697,689,689,696,697,696,690,682,676,668,660,652,646,640,634,630,628,628,627,627,626,624,622,619,618,618,617,615,613,610,606,601,595,589,586,585,585,585,585,585,584,583,583,583,582,582,582,582,582,582,582,582,582,581,579,578,578,578,578,577,576,574,573,571,570,569,567,565,564,563,563,562,562,561,561,560,560,559,558,557,557,554,553,552,550,546,544,541,540,539,537,534,533,532,531,529,525,516,501,488,477,469,458,450,442,434,427,418,407,392,379,365,351,340,332,326,325,324","1710163633978,1710163633991,1710163634008,1710163634025,1710163634041,1710163634058,1710163634075,1710163634091,1710163634108,1710163634125,1710163634141,1710163634158,1710163634175,1710163634192,1710163634381,1710163634391,1710163634408,1710163634425,1710163634441,1710163634458,1710163634475,1710163634491,1710163634508,1710163634525,1710163634542,1710163634558,1710163634813,1710163634825,1710163634842,1710163634859,1710163634875,1710163634891,1710163634908,1710163634925,1710163634942,1710163634958,1710163634975,1710163634991,1710163635008,1710163635025,1710163635041,1710163635058,1710163635075,1710163635091,1710163635108,1710163635125,1710163635142,1710163635159,1710163635175,1710163635192,1710163635209,1710163635225,1710163635241,1710163635258,1710163635275,1710163635292,1710163635308,1710163635325,1710163635341,1710163635358,1710163635375,1710163635392,1710163635409,1710163635425,1710163635442,1710163635459,1710163635475,1710163635491,1710163635508,1710163635525,1710163635542,1710163635559,1710163635575,1710163635592,1710163635689,1710163635709,1710163635725,1710163635742,1710163635759,1710163635911,1710163635925,1710163635941,1710163635975,1710163636091,1710163636109,1710163636125,1710163636404,1710163636425,1710163636549,1710163636559,1710163636575,1710163636592,1710163636706,1710163636725,1710163636741,1710163636759,1710163636775,1710163636792,1710163636875,1710163636892,1710163636908,1710163636925,1710163636942,1710163637015,1710163637025,1710163637042,1710163637058,1710163637075,1710163637091,1710163637108,1710163637125,1710163637141,1710163637158,1710163637175,1710163637192,1710163637208,1710163637225,1710163637241,1710163637258,1710163637275,1710163637292,1710163637308,1710163637325,1710163637341,1710163637358,1710163637375,1710163637392","242866.59999999404","shown","13","stim/12.png","stim/1.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/4.png","974,973,972,971,969,969,968,967,965,963,963,963,963,965,966,967,967,968,968,970,971,972,972,974,975,976,977,977,978,979,980,982,984,987,988,990,991,992,994,996,999,1003,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009,1011,1012,1013,1015,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1025,1027,1027,1021,1005,976,938,884,826,765,717,680,662,659","839,838,830,818,799,780,758,734,712,691,678,667,659,650,639,630,623,618,614,609,604,598,595,591,587,585,583,582,581,580,579,577,576,575,574,574,574,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,573,574,574,574,574,574,574,571,566,557,541,516,492,471,447,424,398,371,348,336,332","1710163645936,1710163645942,1710163645959,1710163645975,1710163645992,1710163646009,1710163646025,1710163646042,1710163646059,1710163646075,1710163646092,1710163646109,1710163646125,1710163646143,1710163646159,1710163646175,1710163646193,1710163646209,1710163646226,1710163646242,1710163646259,1710163646275,1710163646292,1710163646309,1710163646326,1710163646342,1710163646359,1710163646376,1710163646392,1710163646409,1710163646426,1710163646443,1710163646459,1710163646476,1710163646493,1710163646509,1710163646543,1710163646559,1710163646576,1710163646593,1710163646609,1710163646626,1710163646643,1710163646676,1710163646693,1710163646709,1710163646759,1710163646776,1710163646792,1710163646809,1710163646826,1710163646842,1710163646859,1710163646876,1710163646892,1710163646909,1710163647192,1710163647209,1710163647226,1710163647242,1710163647259,1710163647275,1710163647292,1710163647309,1710163647325,1710163647342,1710163647359,1710163647375,1710163647392,1710163647409,1710163647426","254824.59999999404","shown","15","stim/4.png","stim/2.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/7.png","980,980,980,980,980,979,978,975,972,970,968,967,963,959,956,956,956,956,956,958,959,960,961,961,962,962,962,962,961,957,953,949,945,940,936,932,926,921,917,915,914,912,909,908,907,906,905,904,902,901,900,900,899,897,896,894,892,889,885,883,879,876,873,869,866,865,864,864,863,862,861,861,860,859,859,858,857,856,855,853,853,853,854,856,857,859,862,866,872,881,891,902,913,924,932,941,951,961,969,976,982,987,992,997,1001,1005,1007,1008,1009,1011,1012,1013,1014,1015,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1025,1027,1029,1030,1031,1032,1034,1037,1040,1043,1045,1048,1049,1050,1052,1054,1056,1057,1058,1059,1061,1063,1065,1066,1068,1069,1070,1072,1073,1074,1075,1077,1078,1079,1081,1082,1083,1085,1086,1087,1088,1088,1089,1089,1090,1090,1091,1091,1091,1091,1091,1091,1091,1094,1103,1119,1136,1150,1163,1172,1179,1184,1189,1193,1194","851,848,846,842,836,827,816,805,796,788,776,763,745,731,721,713,708,701,692,684,676,668,662,657,653,649,644,640,635,629,622,616,611,605,601,597,594,592,589,589,588,588,588,587,587,587,587,586,585,585,585,584,584,583,583,581,580,579,577,576,575,573,571,568,567,566,566,564,563,563,562,560,559,558,556,555,553,551,550,548,547,546,545,544,543,543,542,540,539,538,537,536,536,535,535,535,534,534,534,534,534,534,534,535,535,535,535,535,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,536,535,535,535,533,533,532,532,531,531,531,530,530,530,529,528,528,527,526,526,524,524,523,523,523,522,520,520,519,518,518,516,515,515,514,513,512,512,511,511,510,510,509,508,507,506,505,502,491,473,444,414,395,380,370,362,356,351,349,349","1710163659752,1710163659776,1710163659793,1710163659810,1710163659827,1710163659843,1710163659859,1710163659876,1710163659893,1710163659909,1710163659926,1710163659943,1710163659960,1710163659976,1710163659993,1710163660010,1710163660027,1710163660043,1710163660060,1710163660076,1710163660093,1710163660110,1710163660126,1710163660143,1710163660160,1710163660176,1710163660193,1710163660210,1710163660226,1710163660243,1710163660260,1710163660276,1710163660293,1710163660310,1710163660326,1710163660343,1710163660360,1710163660376,1710163660393,1710163660410,1710163660426,1710163660443,1710163660460,1710163660476,1710163660493,1710163660510,1710163660709,1710163662143,1710163662160,1710163662193,1710163662226,1710163662243,1710163662539,1710163662560,1710163662577,1710163662594,1710163662610,1710163662627,1710163662644,1710163662660,1710163662676,1710163662694,1710163662710,1710163662727,1710163662743,1710163662760,1710163662776,1710163662810,1710163662827,1710163662843,1710163662860,1710163662877,1710163662893,1710163662910,1710163662926,1710163662943,1710163662960,1710163662976,1710163662993,1710163663010,1710163663060,1710163663985,1710163664010,1710163664027,1710163664043,1710163664060,1710163664077,1710163664093,1710163664110,1710163664127,1710163664143,1710163664160,1710163664176,1710163664193,1710163664210,1710163664227,1710163664243,1710163664260,1710163664277,1710163664293,1710163664310,1710163664327,1710163664343,1710163664360,1710163664377,1710163664393,1710163664410,1710163664444,1710163664460,1710163664477,1710163664494,1710163664510,1710163664527,1710163664543,1710163664577,1710163665102,1710163665127,1710163665160,1710163665210,1710163665244,1710163665260,1710163665277,1710163665294,1710163665310,1710163665327,1710163665344,1710163665360,1710163665377,1710163665393,1710163665410,1710163665427,1710163665443,1710163665460,1710163665477,1710163665494,1710163665510,1710163665527,1710163665543,1710163665560,1710163665577,1710163665593,1710163665627,1710163665643,1710163665660,1710163665677,1710163665694,1710163665710,1710163665727,1710163665744,1710163665760,1710163665777,1710163665810,1710163665827,1710163665843,1710163665860,1710163665877,1710163665893,1710163665910,1710163665927,1710163665943,1710163665960,1710163665977,1710163665993,1710163666010,1710163666027,1710163666060,1710163666077,1710163666205,1710163666331,1710163668228,1710163668243,1710163668753,1710163668760,1710163668777,1710163668793,1710163668810,1710163668827,1710163668843,1710163668860,1710163668877,1710163668893,1710163668910,1710163668927,1710163668943,1710163668960","268640.6999999881","shown","17","stim/8.png","stim/7.png","",""

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

If you was monitoring time, you would see that the mouse was stationary for 15 seconds, which then suggests that the decision was hard to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/6.png","985,982,979,978,977,977,978,979,979,979,979,979,979,979,979,980,980,977,974,971,967,966,964,962,962,962,961,959,957,954,951,947,942,937,929,920,910,900,893,887,883,878,872,867,864,863,862,861,860,859,858,857,856,854,853,852,852,851,850,850,850,850,849,849,849,848,848,848,848,848,848,848,848,849,849,850,850,850,851,851,852,852,854,858,859,861,864,866,868,869,870,871,872,875,884,898,924,954,969,966,950,930,906,875,844,813,785,760,740,729,727","849,849,850,850,850,849,848,847,846,845,844,843,842,841,840,831,811,782,753,725,705,693,683,674,668,662,658,653,648,644,640,636,630,624,615,607,599,590,584,580,577,575,573,571,570,570,570,570,569,569,568,568,566,564,563,562,561,559,558,557,556,555,555,554,553,552,550,549,548,547,544,540,535,529,525,522,521,520,519,518,517,516,516,514,513,512,512,511,511,511,511,511,511,511,511,512,501,472,438,401,371,353,339,328,322,319,318,316,316,315,315","1710163685174,1710163685194,1710163685211,1710163685228,1710163685285,1710163685314,1710163685328,1710163685344,1710163685361,1710163685401,1710163685411,1710163685428,1710163685444,1710163685757,1710163685761,1710163685778,1710163685794,1710163685811,1710163685828,1710163685844,1710163685861,1710163685878,1710163685894,1710163685911,1710163685928,1710163685945,1710163685962,1710163685978,1710163685994,1710163686011,1710163686028,1710163686044,1710163686061,1710163686078,1710163686094,1710163686111,1710163686128,1710163686144,1710163686161,1710163686178,1710163686195,1710163686212,1710163686228,1710163686245,1710163686261,1710163686295,1710163686311,1710163686328,1710163686345,1710163686362,1710163686412,1710163686428,1710163686445,1710163686461,1710163686478,1710163686495,1710163686512,1710163686528,1710163686545,1710163686750,1710163686881,1710163687258,1710163687278,1710163687444,1710163687675,1710163688087,1710163688112,1710163688128,1710163688389,1710163688412,1710163688428,1710163688445,1710163688461,1710163688478,1710163688495,1710163688511,1710163688528,1710163688607,1710163688629,1710163688678,1710163688695,1710163688712,1710163688728,1710163688745,1710163688761,1710163688779,1710163688795,1710163688811,1710163688828,1710163689128,1710163689162,1710163689565,1710163690584,1710163690595,1710163690611,1710163690628,1710163690645,1710163690661,1710163690678,1710163690695,1710163690711,1710163690728,1710163690745,1710163690761,1710163690778,1710163690795,1710163690811,1710163690828,1710163690845,1710163690861,1710163690878","294062.5","shown","19","stim/6.png","stim/12.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/9.png","950,951,953,954,954,955,957,961,963,967,971,985,1006,1025,1041,1048,1051,1051,1049,1045,1038,1030,1021,1012,1001,988,974,961,951,943,937,931,925,919,914,910,909,908,907,906,905,905,905,904,904,901,900,900,899,899,897,896,896,895,895,894,894,893,892,891,889,888,887,885,884,883,881,881,880,880,880,880,881,882,883,884,885,886,887,887,889,889,890,890,891,892,892,893,894,895,895,896,897,900,907,924,951,990,1041,1087,1119,1141,1159,1169,1177,1185,1192,1197,1197,1197,1198,1198","851,851,851,850,849,849,846,843,839,833,828,816,793,764,735,715,703,693,685,676,665,655,645,637,630,622,615,610,606,603,600,599,598,596,596,595,594,594,594,594,594,593,592,592,591,590,589,588,588,587,586,585,584,584,583,583,582,582,581,579,578,577,574,572,569,566,563,561,559,558,557,555,553,551,551,550,549,548,547,546,546,545,545,544,544,544,543,543,542,542,541,541,541,539,535,526,508,482,447,413,388,368,349,337,329,323,321,321,320,321,322,323","1710163700236,1710163700245,1710163700262,1710163700279,1710163700296,1710163700312,1710163700346,1710163700363,1710163700379,1710163700395,1710163700412,1710163700429,1710163700445,1710163700462,1710163700479,1710163700495,1710163700512,1710163700529,1710163700545,1710163700562,1710163700579,1710163700595,1710163700612,1710163700629,1710163700645,1710163700662,1710163700679,1710163700695,1710163700712,1710163700729,1710163700746,1710163700762,1710163700779,1710163700796,1710163700812,1710163700829,1710163700846,1710163700862,1710163700879,1710163700896,1710163700912,1710163700929,1710163700992,1710163706566,1710163706580,1710163706596,1710163706629,1710163706646,1710163706663,1710163706680,1710163706696,1710163706729,1710163706746,1710163706763,1710163706796,1710163706829,1710163706863,1710163706880,1710163706896,1710163706912,1710163706929,1710163706946,1710163706963,1710163706980,1710163706996,1710163707013,1710163707029,1710163707046,1710163707063,1710163707096,1710163707113,1710163707129,1710163707146,1710163707163,1710163707179,1710163707196,1710163707213,1710163707229,1710163707246,1710163707279,1710163707313,1710163707330,1710163707380,1710163707413,1710163707430,1710163707446,1710163707463,1710163708140,1710163708163,1710163708259,1710163708279,1710163708296,1710163708313,1710163708330,1710163708346,1710163708362,1710163708379,1710163708396,1710163708413,1710163708429,1710163708446,1710163708463,1710163708479,1710163708496,1710163708513,1710163708529,1710163708546,1710163708563,1710163708579,1710163708648,1710163708663,1710163708665","309124.40000000596","shown","21","stim/1.png","stim/9.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/4.png","965,968,970,976,982,991,1003,1014,1021,1023,1021,1016,1011,1005,1000,995,989,981,973,965,954,937,919,905,895,888,884,880,878,877,877,879,883,890,899,913,926,939,955,968,980,991,1000,1004,1006,1007,1008,1010,1011,1014,1016,1018,1018,1019,1019,1020,1026,1044,1073,1111,1148,1180,1203,1216,1225,1229,1230,1231,1232,1233,1233,1234,1234,1234,1235","850,849,845,841,832,817,788,753,718,688,666,650,635,624,616,608,599,591,583,577,570,560,551,545,540,536,533,528,526,524,521,514,508,503,500,497,497,497,498,501,503,507,509,511,512,513,515,518,520,525,529,532,534,535,536,536,536,533,523,508,483,450,417,393,375,363,356,353,352,352,351,351,352,353,354","1710163717596,1710163717613,1710163717630,1710163717646,1710163717663,1710163717680,1710163717696,1710163717713,1710163717730,1710163717746,1710163717763,1710163717780,1710163717796,1710163717813,1710163717830,1710163717846,1710163717863,1710163717880,1710163717896,1710163717913,1710163717930,1710163717946,1710163717963,1710163717980,1710163717996,1710163718013,1710163718030,1710163718047,1710163718064,1710163718080,1710163718097,1710163718113,1710163718130,1710163718146,1710163718163,1710163718180,1710163718197,1710163718213,1710163718230,1710163718247,1710163718263,1710163718280,1710163718296,1710163718313,1710163718330,1710163718347,1710163718363,1710163718380,1710163718397,1710163718413,1710163718430,1710163718447,1710163718463,1710163718480,1710163718497,1710163718649,1710163718663,1710163718680,1710163718697,1710163718713,1710163718730,1710163718747,1710163718763,1710163718780,1710163718796,1710163718813,1710163718830,1710163718847,1710163718864,1710163718880,1710163718897,1710163718913,1710163718985,1710163718997,1710163718999","326485.2999999821","shown","23","stim/6.png","stim/4.png","",""

If you was monitoring time, you would see that the mouse was stationary for 15 seconds, which then suggests that the decision was hard to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/10.png","945,946,950,956,964,973,980,987,988,988,986,983,979,973,966,959,950,943,939,937,936,935,934,933,932,931,930,929,927,925,924,924,922,922,921,921,920,920,919,919,918,917,916,915,914,912,910,907,904,902,900,898,897,896,895,895,894,894,893,892,892,891,890,889,888,886,885,884,883,883,882,881,881,880,880,879,878,878,877,877,876,875,875,874,874,872,871,869,867,866,865,864,863,862,862,861,861,860,859,859,858,858,857,857,856,856,856,855,855,854,854,854,854,853,853,853,853,853,853,853,853,854,855,855,856,857,858,861,866,875,890,913,944,990,1039,1082,1117,1144,1162,1176,1185,1192,1201,1209,1213,1217,1218,1218,1218,1218","846,846,846,845,839,830,818,797,774,748,727,710,694,677,663,649,636,628,626,623,622,620,619,616,615,613,612,610,606,604,603,602,600,599,599,598,598,597,597,596,595,594,593,593,591,590,589,587,586,585,583,582,581,581,581,580,579,578,578,578,577,577,576,575,574,573,573,573,572,571,571,571,570,570,569,569,569,568,568,567,567,567,566,566,565,565,564,564,563,562,561,561,560,559,558,558,557,557,557,556,556,555,555,554,554,553,552,552,551,551,550,549,548,548,547,546,545,544,543,542,541,541,541,540,540,540,539,538,535,530,522,512,500,484,468,448,429,410,395,382,371,363,355,350,348,346,346,347,348,350","1710163749592,1710163749599,1710163749615,1710163749632,1710163749648,1710163749665,1710163749682,1710163749698,1710163749715,1710163749732,1710163749748,1710163749765,1710163749782,1710163749798,1710163749815,1710163749832,1710163749848,1710163749865,1710163749882,1710163749898,1710163749915,1710163749932,1710163749949,1710163749965,1710163749982,1710163749998,1710163750016,1710163750032,1710163750049,1710163750065,1710163750082,1710163750099,1710163750116,1710163750132,1710163750165,1710163750199,1710163750249,1710163750266,1710163750414,1710163750432,1710163750449,1710163750466,1710163750482,1710163750499,1710163750532,1710163750549,1710163750565,1710163750582,1710163750599,1710163750616,1710163750632,1710163750648,1710163750665,1710163750682,1710163750699,1710163750716,1710163750749,1710163750782,1710163750799,1710163750816,1710163750849,1710163750865,1710163750882,1710163750899,1710163750915,1710163750932,1710163750949,1710163750965,1710163750982,1710163750999,1710163751015,1710163751094,1710163751214,1710163752204,1710163752215,1710163752232,1710163752337,1710163752365,1710163752450,1710163752482,1710163752544,1710163752646,1710163752665,1710163752698,1710163752732,1710163752749,1710163752765,1710163752782,1710163752799,1710163752815,1710163752865,1710163753092,1710163753098,1710163753115,1710163753132,1710163753148,1710163753182,1710163753215,1710163753304,1710163753372,1710163753398,1710163753584,1710163753599,1710163753616,1710163753649,1710163753682,1710163753732,1710163753748,1710163753857,1710163753865,1710163753915,1710163754003,1710163754032,1710163754049,1710163754065,1710163754099,1710163754311,1710163754412,1710163754460,1710163754507,1710163754687,1710163754915,1710163754948,1710163754982,1710163755032,1710163755222,1710163755232,1710163755249,1710163755265,1710163755282,1710163755298,1710163755315,1710163755332,1710163755348,1710163755365,1710163755382,1710163755398,1710163755415,1710163755432,1710163755448,1710163755465,1710163755482,1710163755498,1710163755515,1710163755532,1710163755548,1710163755641,1710163755665,1710163755677,1710163755682","358481.1999999881","shown","28","stim/1.png","stim/10.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/4.png","971,971,971,971,971,971,968,962,955,949,943,939,932,924,916,906,900,894,890,889,887,886,885,885,887,890,894,898,902,907,912,918,925,931,936,940,943,945,946,946,947,948,950,962,981,1010,1043,1075,1108,1136,1163,1185,1196,1202,1203,1204","851,848,843,837,829,819,801,780,759,744,734,726,718,709,699,688,679,672,664,657,650,642,636,631,626,621,617,614,612,609,608,606,605,605,604,604,604,603,603,602,602,602,599,586,564,533,497,459,424,395,371,356,349,346,345,345","1710163762216,1710163762232,1710163762249,1710163762265,1710163762282,1710163762299,1710163762315,1710163762332,1710163762349,1710163762366,1710163762382,1710163762399,1710163762415,1710163762432,1710163762449,1710163762466,1710163762482,1710163762499,1710163762515,1710163762532,1710163762549,1710163762566,1710163762582,1710163762599,1710163762615,1710163762632,1710163762649,1710163762666,1710163762682,1710163762699,1710163762716,1710163762732,1710163762749,1710163762766,1710163762783,1710163762799,1710163762816,1710163762832,1710163762849,1710163762883,1710163762916,1710163763122,1710163763132,1710163763149,1710163763166,1710163763182,1710163763199,1710163763216,1710163763232,1710163763249,1710163763266,1710163763282,1710163763299,1710163763316,1710163763333,1710163763441","371104.7999999821","shown","30","stim/5.png","stim/4.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/11.png","968,966,963,959,954,950,945,937,929,923,918,916,912,907,903,900,899,899,899,899,901,903,905,907,909,912,914,916,919,921,924,927,928,929,930,931,932,934,936,937,938,939,940,941,942,942,943,944,945,945,946,946,947,948,948,948,948,948,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,949,948,947,946,946,945,944,943,941,941,939,937,936,934,933,932,931,930,927,926,925,923,922,920,918,916,915,914,914,913,908,893,868,839,806,775,753,737,727,723","850,844,835,824,810,793,768,736,707,687,674,663,651,638,627,619,615,611,607,601,594,589,584,581,578,577,576,574,572,570,569,568,567,567,566,566,566,565,565,565,565,565,565,565,565,564,564,564,564,563,562,561,560,560,559,558,557,556,556,555,554,553,552,551,550,549,548,547,545,543,542,541,539,537,535,532,530,528,524,520,515,510,505,500,496,492,488,486,483,479,476,473,471,469,467,465,462,459,458,458,457,457,451,441,427,407,387,369,356,346,341,338","1710163804102,1710163804118,1710163804135,1710163804151,1710163804168,1710163804185,1710163804201,1710163804219,1710163804235,1710163804251,1710163804268,1710163804285,1710163804301,1710163804318,1710163804335,1710163804351,1710163804369,1710163804385,1710163804401,1710163804418,1710163804435,1710163804451,1710163804468,1710163804485,1710163804501,1710163804519,1710163804535,1710163804551,1710163804568,1710163804585,1710163804601,1710163804618,1710163804635,1710163804651,1710163804685,1710163804701,1710163804735,1710163804752,1710163804769,1710163804802,1710163804819,1710163804835,1710163804851,1710163804885,1710163804935,1710163805003,1710163805035,1710163805052,1710163805179,1710163806056,1710163806188,1710163806304,1710163806335,1710163806351,1710163806368,1710163806621,1710163806678,1710163806759,1710163806802,1710163806873,1710163807069,1710163807102,1710163807194,1710163807219,1710163807251,1710163807285,1710163807319,1710163807352,1710163807369,1710163807402,1710163807419,1710163807435,1710163807452,1710163807468,1710163807485,1710163807502,1710163807519,1710163807535,1710163807552,1710163807568,1710163807585,1710163807602,1710163807618,1710163807635,1710163807652,1710163807668,1710163807685,1710163807702,1710163807719,1710163807735,1710163807752,1710163807769,1710163807785,1710163807802,1710163807819,1710163807835,1710163807852,1710163807868,1710163807885,1710163807902,1710163807988,1710163808686,1710163808702,1710163808718,1710163808735,1710163808752,1710163808768,1710163808785,1710163808802,1710163808818,1710163808835,1710163808852","412991.09999999404","shown","35","stim/11.png","stim/1.png","",""

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

If you was monitoring time, you would see that the mouse was stationary for 15 seconds, which then suggests that the decision was hard to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","Slider","","","","","","","","","41","","","","2228"

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/7.png","943,952,961,971,981,987,987,983,976,970,966,962,960,958,957,957,957,955,954,954,953,952,951,950,949,945,936,927,914,900,888,879,874,871,870,869,869,868,866,864,862,859,857,855,853,852,849,846,843,839,836,834,832,831,830,830,829,828,821,804,776,746,717,698,691,690,690,690,690","842,826,808,789,763,732,698,665,640,622,612,606,602,599,598,597,596,595,594,592,591,590,588,587,587,586,584,582,576,571,567,565,563,562,562,562,561,561,561,560,560,560,559,559,559,559,559,559,561,562,564,565,566,567,567,568,568,568,568,557,532,497,457,423,395,377,367,359,355","1710163884607,1710163884623,1710163884640,1710163884656,1710163884673,1710163884690,1710163884707,1710163884723,1710163884740,1710163884757,1710163884773,1710163884790,1710163884807,1710163884823,1710163884840,1710163884857,1710163884873,1710163884890,1710163884907,1710163884923,1710163884940,1710163884957,1710163884973,1710163885007,1710163887609,1710163887624,1710163887640,1710163887657,1710163887673,1710163887690,1710163887707,1710163887723,1710163887740,1710163887757,1710163887773,1710163887790,1710163887823,1710163887857,1710163887874,1710163887907,1710163887923,1710163887940,1710163887957,1710163887973,1710163887990,1710163888007,1710163888024,1710163888040,1710163888057,1710163888074,1710163888091,1710163888107,1710163888123,1710163888206,1710163888250,1710163888257,1710163888273,1710163889561,1710163889573,1710163889590,1710163889607,1710163889623,1710163889640,1710163889657,1710163889674,1710163889690,1710163889707,1710163889724,1710163889740","493495.40000000596","shown","45","stim/7.png","stim/2.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/4.png","960,960,960,961,964,966,966,965,961,957,952,946,938,932,928,924,922,920,918,917,915,913,912,911,910,909,908,907,907,907,907,907,907,908,911,914,918,922,926,930,934,940,946,954,963,971,977,982,985,988,989,989,989,989,989,988,988,988,988,988,988,988,986,985,984,983,981,978,976,974,973,972,971,967,961,952,936,914,884,845,806,775,750,736,729,726,725","847,843,830,808,781,755,734,719,706,692,678,663,642,624,608,597,591,584,581,577,574,570,566,564,561,558,554,551,550,548,547,546,545,542,541,539,538,536,535,534,534,534,534,534,536,537,537,538,538,538,538,537,533,529,526,524,522,521,520,518,514,510,507,505,502,501,498,495,492,491,490,489,488,486,483,480,476,470,459,444,425,406,386,371,357,351,348","1710163902924,1710163902941,1710163902958,1710163902974,1710163902991,1710163903008,1710163903024,1710163903041,1710163903058,1710163903074,1710163903091,1710163903108,1710163903124,1710163903141,1710163903158,1710163903174,1710163903191,1710163903208,1710163903224,1710163903241,1710163903258,1710163903274,1710163903291,1710163903308,1710163903324,1710163903341,1710163903358,1710163903375,1710163903391,1710163903408,1710163903424,1710163903441,1710163903458,1710163903474,1710163903491,1710163903508,1710163903525,1710163903541,1710163903558,1710163903575,1710163903591,1710163903608,1710163903625,1710163903642,1710163903658,1710163903674,1710163903691,1710163903708,1710163903724,1710163903741,1710163903758,1710163903842,1710163903858,1710163903875,1710163903891,1710163903908,1710163903924,1710163903941,1710163904131,1710163904141,1710163904158,1710163904174,1710163904191,1710163904208,1710163904225,1710163904241,1710163904258,1710163904275,1710163904292,1710163904308,1710163904325,1710163904341,1710163904358,1710163904374,1710163904391,1710163904408,1710163904424,1710163904441,1710163904458,1710163904474,1710163904491,1710163904508,1710163904524,1710163904541,1710163904558,1710163904575,1710163904592","511813.2999999821","shown","48","stim/4.png","stim/8.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/4.png","952,952,953,955,959,967,978,985,987,987,987,987,987,986,985,984,983,982,981,981,980,980,979,979,979,979,979,977,968,948,916,871,828,803,787,776,769,765,764","850,844,834,820,799,768,737,709,691,678,667,656,646,636,626,621,616,610,604,598,592,588,585,582,581,580,579,577,563,540,506,465,429,405,388,377,373,370,370","1710163914270,1710163914292,1710163914309,1710163914325,1710163914342,1710163914358,1710163914375,1710163914392,1710163914408,1710163914425,1710163914442,1710163914458,1710163914475,1710163914492,1710163914508,1710163914526,1710163914542,1710163914558,1710163914575,1710163914592,1710163914608,1710163914626,1710163914642,1710163914658,1710163914675,1710163914725,1710163915186,1710163915192,1710163915208,1710163915225,1710163915242,1710163915258,1710163915275,1710163915292,1710163915308,1710163915325,1710163915342,1710163915358,1710163915392","523158.40000000596","shown","51","stim/4.png","stim/12.png","",""

On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/9.png","970,970,970,970,969,967,963,955,941,919,897,876,860,852,850,850,852,857,864,871,879,886,892,899,908,916,923,929,935,940,944,946,946,946,945,940,922,897,865,830,801,788,789,790,803,835,885,933,966,978,979,978,975,957,924,873,818,777,757,753,752,750","842,841,840,839,831,819,798,768,731,688,653,624,603,586,573,563,553,542,528,515,504,493,486,482,478,472,466,460,453,447,444,443,444,445,445,442,432,419,402,386,377,375,375,375,377,383,389,393,395,396,396,395,393,388,379,372,367,365,365,365,365,365","1710163939219,1710163939260,1710163939371,1710163939377,1710163939393,1710163939410,1710163939426,1710163939443,1710163939460,1710163939476,1710163939493,1710163939510,1710163939526,1710163939543,1710163939559,1710163939576,1710163939593,1710163939610,1710163939626,1710163939643,1710163939660,1710163939676,1710163939693,1710163939710,1710163939726,1710163939743,1710163939760,1710163939776,1710163939793,1710163939810,1710163939826,1710163939843,1710163939906,1710163939926,1710163940264,1710163940276,1710163940293,1710163940310,1710163940326,1710163940343,1710163940360,1710163940376,1710163940438,1710163940443,1710163940460,1710163940476,1710163940493,1710163940510,1710163940526,1710163940543,1710163940560,1710163941720,1710163941726,1710163941743,1710163941760,1710163941776,1710163941793,1710163941810,1710163941826,1710163941843,1710163941893,1710163941910","548108","shown","54","stim/9.png","stim/11.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/6.png","950,949,948,947,946,946,945,943,943,942,942,944,945,946,947,947,949,949,950,952,953,955,956,958,959,961,962,963,963,964,965,966,966,967,967,966,963,957,951,945,943,941,939,937,935,934,932,930,927,922,919,915,913,910,908,907,907,907,907,907,907,907,908,908,908,908,908,908,909,909,909,910,910,910,910,911,911,911,912,912,912,913,913,914,914,914,915,915,915,916,916,917,918,919,920,920,921,922,923,923,923,924,924,925,926,926,926,927,927,928,928,929,929,930,930,931,931,932,932,932,933,934,935,935,936,936,937,938,939,939,940,941,944,947,949,951,953,954,955,955,955,953,946,930,904,868,827,786,745,711,689,676,675,675,680,683,683","833,829,826,824,822,815,802,784,757,729,706,688,676,670,664,660,654,648,642,635,626,614,603,590,580,567,557,547,539,531,524,519,514,508,502,497,491,486,480,477,475,474,472,472,471,471,471,471,471,471,471,471,472,474,475,475,476,475,474,473,472,471,471,470,469,468,467,466,466,465,464,464,463,462,461,461,459,458,458,457,456,456,455,455,454,453,453,452,451,451,450,449,448,447,446,445,444,443,442,441,440,439,438,438,437,435,434,434,433,432,431,431,430,430,429,429,428,428,427,426,426,425,425,424,424,423,423,422,422,421,420,418,416,413,410,407,405,403,401,400,398,395,389,384,380,376,373,373,373,373,373,373,373,374,377,378,379","1710163947959,1710163947977,1710163947993,1710163948010,1710163948027,1710163948043,1710163948060,1710163948077,1710163948093,1710163948110,1710163948127,1710163948143,1710163948160,1710163948177,1710163948193,1710163948210,1710163948227,1710163948243,1710163948260,1710163948277,1710163948293,1710163948310,1710163948327,1710163948343,1710163948360,1710163948377,1710163948393,1710163948410,1710163948427,1710163948443,1710163948460,1710163948477,1710163948494,1710163948510,1710163948527,1710163948544,1710163948560,1710163948577,1710163948593,1710163948610,1710163948627,1710163948644,1710163948661,1710163948677,1710163948694,1710163948711,1710163948727,1710163948743,1710163948760,1710163948777,1710163948794,1710163948811,1710163948827,1710163948844,1710163948860,1710163948910,1710163948927,1710163949562,1710163949594,1710163950175,1710163950194,1710163950262,1710163950671,1710163950865,1710163950964,1710163951034,1710163951095,1710163951144,1710163951161,1710163951223,1710163951270,1710163951294,1710163951347,1710163951456,1710163951477,1710163951494,1710163951510,1710163951544,1710163951560,1710163951594,1710163951668,1710163951677,1710163951778,1710163951827,1710163951861,1710163951928,1710163951960,1710163951994,1710163952047,1710163952077,1710163952111,1710163952144,1710163952160,1710163952178,1710163952194,1710163952211,1710163952244,1710163952261,1710163952277,1710163952311,1710163952361,1710163952377,1710163952411,1710163952427,1710163952444,1710163952477,1710163952528,1710163952544,1710163952560,1710163952594,1710163952644,1710163952661,1710163952678,1710163952694,1710163952711,1710163952767,1710163952794,1710163952827,1710163952844,1710163952860,1710163952877,1710163952910,1710163952944,1710163952977,1710163952994,1710163953027,1710163953044,1710163953077,1710163953127,1710163953144,1710163953161,1710163953178,1710163953194,1710163953210,1710163953227,1710163953244,1710163953260,1710163953277,1710163953294,1710163953310,1710163953327,1710163953344,1710163953361,1710163953377,1710163953394,1710163953410,1710163953427,1710163953444,1710163953460,1710163953477,1710163953494,1710163953510,1710163953527,1710163953544,1710163953561,1710163953577,1710163953594","556848.099999994","shown","56","stim/6.png","stim/7.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/5.png","951,949,947,947,947,946,944,943,943,947,955,963,971,977,983,987,989,991,991,991,990,988,986,982,978,973,968,964,960,957,954,952,948,945,942,940,939,938,937,937,937,937,939,940,941,943,944,945,947,949,951,954,956,960,963,966,970,971,974,976,980,984,988,993,998,1003,1008,1013,1018,1021,1024,1025,1027,1029,1033,1037,1041,1045,1048,1050,1052,1055,1057,1059,1061,1062,1062,1062,1062,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1063,1062,1061,1060,1059,1059,1058,1058,1057,1056,1055,1055,1054,1053,1052,1051,1050,1049,1048,1047,1047,1047,1047,1047,1047,1048,1049,1050,1052,1054,1057,1058,1061,1065,1071,1078,1087,1095,1106,1117,1125,1132,1139,1144,1150,1155,1160,1163,1166,1167,1168,1168,1169","838,837,830,815,795,781,770,763,754,745,734,724,717,711,707,703,699,695,689,682,679,673,667,661,653,646,640,635,631,627,625,621,617,613,610,606,601,597,593,588,585,581,578,575,573,571,569,567,565,563,560,558,555,552,551,549,548,547,547,547,546,546,546,546,547,550,552,555,556,558,559,559,559,559,560,560,560,560,560,559,558,557,555,554,553,552,551,550,549,549,548,547,546,545,544,543,542,541,540,539,538,537,536,535,534,533,532,531,531,530,529,528,528,528,528,527,527,526,525,525,523,522,520,519,518,517,515,514,513,512,510,508,507,504,503,501,499,496,491,485,477,469,458,446,437,428,420,412,404,396,389,383,377,375,373,372,372","1710163960482,1710163960495,1710163960511,1710163960528,1710163960544,1710163960561,1710163960578,1710163960595,1710163960611,1710163960628,1710163960644,1710163960661,1710163960678,1710163960694,1710163960711,1710163960728,1710163960744,1710163960761,1710163960778,1710163960794,1710163960811,1710163960828,1710163960845,1710163960861,1710163960878,1710163960894,1710163960911,1710163960928,1710163960944,1710163960961,1710163960978,1710163960994,1710163961011,1710163961028,1710163961044,1710163961061,1710163961078,1710163961094,1710163961111,1710163961128,1710163961145,1710163961161,1710163961178,1710163961194,1710163961211,1710163961228,1710163961245,1710163961261,1710163961278,1710163961295,1710163961311,1710163961328,1710163961344,1710163961361,1710163961378,1710163961394,1710163961411,1710163961428,1710163961445,1710163961461,1710163961478,1710163961494,1710163961511,1710163961528,1710163961544,1710163961561,1710163961578,1710163961594,1710163961611,1710163961628,1710163961644,1710163961661,1710163961678,1710163961694,1710163961711,1710163961728,1710163961744,1710163961761,1710163961778,1710163961794,1710163961811,1710163961828,1710163961844,1710163961861,1710163961878,1710163961911,1710163961928,1710163961944,1710163961961,1710163961978,1710163962058,1710163962123,1710163962161,1710163962178,1710163962195,1710163962228,1710163962319,1710163962362,1710163962538,1710163963328,1710163963415,1710163963444,1710163963495,1710163963566,1710163963640,1710163963661,1710163963694,1710163963728,1710163963744,1710163963761,1710163963812,1710163963828,1710163963861,1710163963920,1710163963944,1710163963961,1710163964093,1710163964128,1710163964178,1710163964195,1710163964212,1710163964228,1710163964261,1710163964312,1710163964345,1710163964362,1710163964378,1710163964395,1710163964412,1710163964428,1710163964445,1710163964462,1710163964478,1710163964495,1710163964511,1710163964528,1710163964544,1710163964561,1710163964578,1710163964594,1710163964611,1710163964628,1710163964644,1710163964661,1710163964678,1710163964694,1710163964711,1710163964728,1710163964744,1710163964761,1710163964778,1710163964795,1710163964811,1710163964828,1710163964845,1710163965186,1710163965195","569371.400000006","shown","58","stim/11.png","stim/5.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/8.png","964,959,952,941,923,904,893,889,888,887,887,890,895,899,903,908,911,915,917,920,925,929,933,937,941,944,945,945,946,946,946,944,943,942,942,942,942,942,943,944,947,951,954,957,961,964,966,966,967,968,969,969,969,969,968,968,968,968,968,968,969,972,974,978,981,985,989,992,993,994,995,997,997,997,997,997,996,995,993,990,987,983,980,977,975,973,972,971,968,967,962,956,949,943,937,933,931,928,925,921,919,916,915,913,911,909,908,907,907,907,907,907,908,908,910,910,911,912,913,914,916,919,923,924,925,926,927,928,928,928,928,928,928,927,927,926,924,923,921,920,917,913,909,904,899,894,889,884,879,875,869,865,861,859,856,853,851,848,845,843,839,836,833,831,828,825,823,823,821,819,818,816,815,814,813,812,811,810,810,809,808,808,807,807,807,807,808,809,811,816,825,837,854,874,899,926,953,980,1003,1023,1039,1058,1076,1096,1119,1134,1145,1151,1155,1158,1164,1169,1172,1174,1175","838,834,826,813,791,772,758,749,738,728,719,713,709,705,700,696,691,688,686,685,682,680,678,675,671,668,664,660,656,651,645,638,631,625,619,613,610,606,604,601,599,597,595,594,592,591,589,588,586,583,579,576,572,567,563,560,556,554,551,549,547,545,543,541,539,538,536,535,534,533,531,529,527,524,521,519,517,516,513,510,505,501,497,494,491,490,489,488,488,488,488,488,489,490,491,492,492,493,494,495,496,496,496,496,494,491,488,483,479,474,470,467,465,463,461,460,459,459,459,458,458,457,457,457,456,456,456,456,455,454,453,452,451,451,450,450,449,449,448,448,448,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,446,445,445,445,444,444,444,444,444,444,444,443,443,442,442,442,441,440,440,439,439,439,439,439,438,438,438,437,437,436,435,434,433,432,431,428,426,423,419,414,407,400,393,384,377,370,364,358,354,351,348,346,345,344,343,343,342,342,342,341,341","1710163972095,1710163972111,1710163972128,1710163972145,1710163972161,1710163972178,1710163972195,1710163972212,1710163972228,1710163972245,1710163972262,1710163972278,1710163972295,1710163972312,1710163972328,1710163972345,1710163972362,1710163972379,1710163972395,1710163972412,1710163972428,1710163972445,1710163972462,1710163972478,1710163972495,1710163972512,1710163972528,1710163972545,1710163972562,1710163972578,1710163972595,1710163972612,1710163972628,1710163972645,1710163972662,1710163972679,1710163972695,1710163972712,1710163972728,1710163972745,1710163972762,1710163972778,1710163972795,1710163972812,1710163972828,1710163972845,1710163972862,1710163972879,1710163972895,1710163972912,1710163972928,1710163972945,1710163972962,1710163972978,1710163972995,1710163973012,1710163973028,1710163973045,1710163973062,1710163973079,1710163973095,1710163973112,1710163973128,1710163973145,1710163973162,1710163973179,1710163973195,1710163973212,1710163973228,1710163973245,1710163973262,1710163973279,1710163973295,1710163973312,1710163973329,1710163973345,1710163973362,1710163973379,1710163973395,1710163973412,1710163973428,1710163973445,1710163973462,1710163973478,1710163973495,1710163973512,1710163973528,1710163973545,1710163973562,1710163973579,1710163973596,1710163973612,1710163973628,1710163973645,1710163973662,1710163973678,1710163973695,1710163973712,1710163973728,1710163973745,1710163973762,1710163973779,1710163973795,1710163973812,1710163973828,1710163973845,1710163973862,1710163973878,1710163973895,1710163973912,1710163973928,1710163973945,1710163973962,1710163973978,1710163973995,1710163974012,1710163974028,1710163974045,1710163974062,1710163974078,1710163974095,1710163974112,1710163974128,1710163974145,1710163974195,1710163974245,1710163974342,1710163974405,1710163976415,1710163976429,1710163976462,1710163976521,1710163976605,1710163976629,1710163976645,1710163976662,1710163976679,1710163976695,1710163976712,1710163976729,1710163976746,1710163976762,1710163976779,1710163976796,1710163976812,1710163976829,1710163976845,1710163976862,1710163976879,1710163976895,1710163976912,1710163976929,1710163976945,1710163976962,1710163976979,1710163976995,1710163977012,1710163977029,1710163977045,1710163977062,1710163977079,1710163977096,1710163977112,1710163977129,1710163977162,1710163977196,1710163977229,1710163977246,1710163977262,1710163977279,1710163977296,1710163977312,1710163977329,1710163977346,1710163977362,1710163977396,1710163977445,1710163977542,1710163977545,1710163977562,1710163977612,1710163977629,1710163977781,1710163978118,1710163978162,1710163978196,1710163978212,1710163978229,1710163978246,1710163978262,1710163978279,1710163978295,1710163978312,1710163978329,1710163978345,1710163978362,1710163978379,1710163978395,1710163978412,1710163978429,1710163978445,1710163978462,1710163978479,1710163978495,1710163978512,1710163978529,1710163978545,1710163978562,1710163978579,1710163978595,1710163978612,1710163978629,1710163978645,1710163978659,1710163978679","580983.900000006","shown","60","stim/2.png","stim/8.png","",""

On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

On some my mouse was very still when I was contemplating which unless you are tracking mouse movement times would not be in the data, and I believe that it would be a very good addition to this study.

For example:
2 options are given A and B.

My mouse starts towards A in a nice ark and then b lines to B. No other lines are present as the mouse was stationary inbetween. You are not monitoring time and only 2 lines are shown. This is a likely indicator that the decision was easy to make.

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/12.png","945,946,952,961,973,984,989,991,991,991,988,980,973,967,961,956,952,947,944,942,940,940,939,939,939,939,939,939,939,939,940,941,941,943,945,946,947,949,949,949,949,948,947,945,943,941,940,939,939,939,939,938,938,938,937,937,937,937,937,937,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,938,936,935,931,924,912,895,875,850,825,799,779,764,754,745,737,731,725,719,717,716,716","847,847,841,829,810,790,778,768,758,747,731,715,705,697,690,684,678,671,666,662,658,654,651,647,643,641,638,634,632,629,627,626,624,621,618,616,612,610,607,604,601,599,596,593,590,588,587,584,582,580,577,575,572,571,569,568,567,566,565,564,563,561,560,559,558,557,555,554,553,552,551,550,548,546,543,539,533,527,518,509,498,484,469,456,443,431,419,407,396,383,372,365,359,357","1710163992071,1710163992079,1710163992096,1710163992113,1710163992129,1710163992146,1710163992163,1710163992179,1710163992196,1710163992213,1710163992229,1710163992246,1710163992263,1710163992279,1710163992296,1710163992313,1710163992329,1710163992346,1710163992363,1710163992379,1710163992396,1710163992413,1710163992430,1710163992446,1710163992463,1710163992479,1710163992496,1710163992513,1710163992530,1710163992547,1710163992563,1710163992580,1710163992596,1710163992613,1710163992630,1710163992646,1710163992663,1710163992680,1710163992696,1710163992713,1710163992730,1710163992746,1710163992763,1710163992780,1710163992796,1710163992813,1710163992829,1710163992846,1710163992863,1710163992879,1710163992896,1710163992913,1710163992929,1710163992946,1710163992963,1710163992979,1710163993013,1710163993096,1710163993129,1710163993146,1710163993179,1710163993213,1710163993229,1710163993246,1710163993263,1710163993279,1710163993296,1710163993313,1710163993330,1710163993346,1710163993363,1710163993380,1710163993396,1710163993413,1710163993430,1710163993446,1710163993463,1710163993479,1710163993496,1710163993513,1710163993529,1710163993546,1710163993563,1710163993579,1710163993596,1710163993613,1710163993629,1710163993646,1710163993663,1710163993679,1710163993696,1710163993713,1710163993729,1710163993746","600960.400000006","shown","63","stim/12.png","stim/10.png","",""

Anyway thanks for the study and good luck with the results.","","trial","","","stim/7.png","968,968,968,968,967,965,960,957,956,954,952,950,949,949,949,949,949,948,948,948,948,948,948,948,948,949,952,955,957,958,960,961,961,962,963,964,964,964,964,964,963,961,959,958,957,957,956,956,955,955,955,955,955,955,956,957,959,961,962,965,968,972,975,979,982,985,987,991,994,999,1004,1009,1014,1019,1028,1042,1059,1075,1088,1102,1116,1129,1144,1159,1174,1190,1201,1212,1221,1227,1233,1236,1239,1241,1242","845,838,828,812,795,781,772,764,758,750,741,733,725,720,715,710,704,700,695,693,690,689,687,684,682,676,671,667,663,660,656,653,649,647,644,641,638,636,632,627,623,619,615,611,607,604,598,595,592,588,585,582,579,575,572,570,567,564,560,558,554,550,546,543,541,539,537,535,533,532,530,527,526,523,521,518,514,509,503,497,489,479,466,455,442,429,419,407,396,388,381,375,369,366,364","1710164000063,1710164000080,1710164000096,1710164000113,1710164000130,1710164000146,1710164000163,1710164000180,1710164000196,1710164000213,1710164000230,1710164000246,1710164000263,1710164000280,1710164000296,1710164000314,1710164000330,1710164000347,1710164000364,1710164000380,1710164000397,1710164000414,1710164000430,1710164000447,1710164000464,1710164000480,1710164000497,1710164000513,1710164000530,1710164000546,1710164000564,1710164000580,1710164000596,1710164000613,1710164000630,1710164000646,1710164000666,1710164000680,1710164000697,1710164000713,1710164000730,1710164000746,1710164000763,1710164000780,1710164000796,1710164000814,1710164000830,1710164000847,1710164000864,1710164000880,1710164000896,1710164000913,1710164000930,1710164000946,1710164000963,1710164000980,1710164000996,1710164001013,1710164001030,1710164001047,1710164001063,1710164001080,1710164001097,1710164001113,1710164001130,1710164001147,1710164001163,1710164001180,1710164001197,1710164001214,1710164001230,1710164001247,1710164001263,1710164001280,1710164001296,1710164001313,1710164001330,1710164001347,1710164001363,1710164001380,1710164001396,1710164001413,1710164001430,1710164001446,1710164001463,1710164001480,1710164001496,1710164001513,1710164001530,1710164001546,1710164001563,1710164001580,1710164001597,1710164001613,1710164001630","608952.2999999821","shown","65","stim/10.png","stim/7.png","",""
